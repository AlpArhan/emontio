EMONTIO
=======

# Purpose:

Emontio is a research project that aims to optimize investors' decision-making process about stock prices based on news release. It scans a targeted web page's articles, extracts the ones that are relevant to stock name and ticker symbol you are looking for. Later, it conducts tone and sentiment analysis on the relevant paragraphs. For more information please visit emont.io

How to improve: The best way to improve Emontio would be to transform the algorithm so that it can scan news at high-frequency. Detect the new news articles as they are published, and instantly run tone and sentiment analysis, ultimately to see the news release's impact on the stock market in that moment. Apart from that, depending on the analysis needs, Emontio needs improvement on the date of the articles it extracts. If you want to specify a certain date or time, plugging that information into the algorithm can have good impact on the analysis.

# Requirements:

Emontio is written in Python, and the following python libraries are used: Pandas, NumPy, Newspaper API, Watson Developer Cloud, AlchemyAPI.
